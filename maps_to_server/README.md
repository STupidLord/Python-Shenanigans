# `maps_to_server.py` and `old maps_to_server.py`
As you should be able to guess, `maps_to_server.py` is the new version of `old maps_to_server.py`.

The latter only exists as a sort of very general basis of what I want the new one to do.

Originally I didn't push the old one because I didn't want it to see the light of day, but I later realized that I might as well push it while it's sitting in this dir. I don't even know if it fully in it's current state since I was preparing to rework it before deciding to just completely redo it as a new file.

# PEP 8
I refuse to let a code formatter touch my code, ever. However, I know following some standards might be beneficial in the long run if I want to ever touch other codebases. To remedy my hatred of code formatters; I simply went through my code and made it loosely compliant (loosely doing heavy lifting) with some PEP 8 things.

I'll be honest, I'm not a big fan of following something like PEP 8 as I'm used to being able to format my stuff however I want, but I understand the use case and respect those who follow it.
