# `maps_to_server.py` and `old maps_to_server.py`
As you should be able to guess, `maps_to_server.py` is the new version of `old maps_to_server.py`.

The latter only exists as a sort of very general basis of what I want the new one to do.

Originally I didn't push the old one because I didn't want it to see the light of day, but I later realized that I might as well push it while it's sitting in this dir. I don't even know if it fully in it's current state since I was preparing to rework it before deciding to just completely redo it as a new file.
