Randomly decided to make this repo just so I can keep track of my changes to these shitty py files I've made over the year(s).
I'm so bad at this shit it's unreal (engine???).

If you're reading this, hi and welcome to my personal hellhole.

Looking through these files may give the impression that I am schizophrenic... I might be.

HOWEVER, I personally attribute the completely absurdity of these files to me having random moments where I start making python code every few months.

Rule of thumb, expect every py file to not work because it's made by me.

# Spelling
I can't spell, especially since I like to code at midnight when half asleep.
